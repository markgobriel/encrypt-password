# password encryptor

this is a python project which encrypts passwords. 
you give it a message, and then a cipher.
it will then encrypt the message by splitting it up into rows corresponding to the length of the cipher, and then write each column one at a time in alphabetical order of the cipher.
for instance, the message 'ILOVEPINEAPPLE' and the cipher 'JUICE' would return the encrypted password 'VEEEAONLIPPLIP'
<br> <br> this was done for my CSC108 course at the University of Toronto.
